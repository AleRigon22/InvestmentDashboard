Looking at the design reference and requirements, I need to create a full-stack investment portfolio tracker with manual data entry. The design shows a clean, modern interface with authentication, dashboard with charts, holdings management, transactions, dividends, and cash movements tracking.

Key components needed:
1. Complete database schema with 6 tables (users, assets, transactions, prices, dividends, cash_movements)
2. Authentication system with JWT/session-based auth
3. Backend API with CRUD operations for all entities
4. Frontend with React components matching the design reference exactly
5. Charts using Recharts library
6. Bottom navigation for mobile-friendly design
7. Form handling with validation

The design reference shows a sophisticated financial application with:
- Login/registration forms
- Dashboard with KPI cards and charts
- Holdings table with P&L calculations
- Transaction management
- Dividend tracking with charts
- Cash movement management
- Bottom navigation between views

I'll implement this using the existing project structure with proper TypeScript, authentication, and database integration.

# useful_guidelines_from_blueprints

From the javascript_database blueprint:
- Add the necessary Drizzle models and relations to `shared/schema.ts`
- Always explicitly model relations using the `relations` operator from `drizzle-orm`
- Update `server/storage.ts` to replace MemStorage with DatabaseStorage
- Execute `npm run db:push` command to push schema changes
