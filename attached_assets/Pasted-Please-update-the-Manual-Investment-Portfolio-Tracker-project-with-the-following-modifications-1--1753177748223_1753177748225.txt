Please update the Manual Investment Portfolio Tracker project with the following modifications:

1️⃣ Dashboard Graph – Align with History Page Graph
Current issue:
The Dashboard graph and the History page graph use different structures.

Required fix:
Make the Dashboard graph identical to the History graph, using the same structure as the example provided (multi-line by category).

Categories to display:

Line	Represents
ETF	Total ETF value over time
Stocks	Total stock value over time
Crypto	Total crypto value over time
Bonds/Funds	Total bond/fund value over time

Data Source:
Both graphs (Dashboard and History) must pull their data directly from the snapshots stored in the History page.

2️⃣ P&L Formatting – Add Negative Sign
Current issue:
When P&L is negative, it does not display a minus sign clearly.

Required fix:
Format the P&L values so that:

Condition	Display
Positive	+€x.xx
Negative	–€x.xx (with minus sign)

Apply this formatting to:

Holdings P&L

History P&L

Dashboard P&L

3️⃣ Holdings – Enable Full Edit of Data
Current issue:
Holdings data is not editable in full, or changes are not saved properly.

Required fix:
Allow editing of all relevant fields in Holdings:

Asset Name

Ticker

Category (Stocks, ETF, Crypto, Bonds/Funds)

Sector

Region

Currency

Quantity

Average Price

Current Price

Pre-fill all fields with existing values.

Save the updated data and recalculate Market Value and P&L immediately.

4️⃣ Fix Current Price Edit
Current issue:
Editing the Current Price does not update the data.

Required fix:
Ensure that when the Current Price is edited:

The new price is saved correctly.

The system recalculates:

Market Value = Current Price × Quantity

Unrealized P&L = Market Value – Book Value

Reflect the changes in:

Holdings Table

Dashboard

Asset Detail Page (if present)

5️⃣ Edit Portfolio Snapshot – Month Selection Dropdown
Current issue:
When editing a snapshot, the month is shown as a number input.

Required fix:
Replace the number field with a dropdown menu listing the months by name:

Value	Label
01	Gennaio
02	Febbraio
03	Marzo
04	Aprile
05	Maggio
06	Giugno
07	Luglio
08	Agosto
09	Settembre
10	Ottobre
11	Novembre
12	Dicembre

The year remains a separate dropdown or field.

6️⃣ Snapshot Data – Save 4 Asset Categories
Current issue:
When saving snapshots, the system does not store the current value of each asset category (Stocks, ETF, Crypto, Bonds).

Required fix:
Each snapshot must include:

Field	Data
Stocks Value	Total value of stocks at snapshot date
ETF Value	Total value of ETFs
Crypto Value	Total value of crypto
Bonds/Funds Value	Total value of bonds/funds

This data must be saved in each snapshot and used for:

History graphs

Dashboard graphs

Performance analysis

7️⃣ Summary of Actions
Feature	Action
Dashboard Graph	Replace with the multi-line category graph, identical to History
P&L Formatting	Display negative P&L with a clear – sign
Holdings Edit	Allow full editing of holdings data
Current Price	Fix edit/save logic and recalculate values
Snapshot Edit	Use a month name dropdown instead of numeric input
Snapshot Save	Save per-category values (Stocks, ETF, Crypto, Bonds) in all snapshots

Final instruction to Replit AI:
Apply these changes to the current project.
Ensure that the graphs, holdings management, snapshot system, and calculations work consistently and as described.
Test the full flow for data editing, snapshot management, and historical reporting.
