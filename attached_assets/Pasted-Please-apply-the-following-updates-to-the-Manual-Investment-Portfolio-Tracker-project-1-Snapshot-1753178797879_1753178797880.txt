Please apply the following updates to the Manual Investment Portfolio Tracker project:

1️⃣ Snapshot Accordion – Expandable Categories
Current issue:
The All Snapshots list only shows global values (Total Value, Invested, P&L, P&L %) and does not show category breakdown.

Required fix:
Add a left arrow (▶) next to each snapshot month.

When the user clicks the arrow, expand a collapsible accordion showing the 4 asset categories with detailed values:

Category	Total Value	Invested	P&L	P&L %
Stocks	€	€	€	%
ETF	€	€	€	%
Crypto	€	€	€	%
Bonds/Funds	€	€	€	%

Make all fields editable, allowing the user to modify category-level values even after the snapshot is saved.

After changes, update the snapshot totals automatically.

2️⃣ Recent Transactions – Correct Navigation
Current issue:
Clicking on Recent Transactions in the Dashboard does nothing.

Required fix:
Make the Recent Transactions section clickable, redirecting the user to the Transactions Page.

3️⃣ Dashboard Graph – Y-Axis Fix
Current issue:
In the Dashboard graph, the Y-axis is stuck at €0, regardless of the data.

Required fix:
Ensure the Y-axis auto-scales based on the highest data point in the current dataset.

Display values starting from 0 up to the correct maximum.

4️⃣ P&L Formatting – Double Minus Sign
Current issue:
Some P&L values display two minus signs, like –-6.25%.

Required fix:
Sanitize P&L formatting so that:

Condition	Display
Positive	+x.xx%
Negative	–x.xx%

Ensure there is only one minus sign even when the raw value is negative.

5️⃣ Delete Closed Positions
New feature:

Add a "Delete" button for closed positions in the Holdings page.

When clicked:

Show a confirmation popup:
"Are you sure you want to delete this closed position? This will remove the historical data of this position."

If confirmed, remove the closed position and update all summaries.

6️⃣ Summary of Actions
Feature	Action
Snapshot Accordion	Expand each snapshot to show category-level values, editable inline
Navigation	Make Recent Transactions link to the Transactions page
Dashboard Graph	Fix Y-axis scaling
P&L Formatting	Ensure no double minus in negative P&L
Closed Positions	Add option to delete closed positions with confirmation

Final instruction to Replit AI:
