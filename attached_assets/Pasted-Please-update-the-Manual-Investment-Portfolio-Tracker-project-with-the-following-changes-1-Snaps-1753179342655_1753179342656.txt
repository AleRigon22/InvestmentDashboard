Please update the Manual Investment Portfolio Tracker project with the following changes:

1️⃣ Snapshot Accordion – Uniform Visual Design
Current issue:
The category breakdown inside the Snapshot accordion uses a different visual style from the main snapshot list. It looks detached from the rest of the UI.

Required fix:
Make the accordion expanded view have the same visual structure and columns as the main snapshot list.

Each asset category (Stocks, ETFs, Crypto, Bonds/Funds) must be displayed as separate rows, styled like snapshot rows.

Columns to include (per category row):
Column	Function
Category Name	e.g., Stocks, ETFs, Crypto, Bonds/Funds
Total Value	Editable input (pre-filled)
Invested	Editable input (pre-filled)
P&L (€)	Auto-calculated = (Total Value – Invested)
P&L (%)	Auto-calculated = ((Total Value / Invested) – 1) × 100
Actions	Edit/Save button on the right (same icon/button as in Holdings and Snapshots)

2️⃣ Interaction Behavior
When the user clicks the accordion arrow (▶):

Show the 4 category rows with consistent design.

Pre-fill the values for Total Value and Invested.

Automatically calculate and display P&L and P&L %.

All values must be editable by clicking the Action button (pencil icon or Save button) in the Actions column, just like other components of the app.

3️⃣ Auto-update Totals
When the user modifies category values and saves:

The system must recalculate the snapshot's total value, invested, P&L, and P&L % automatically.

Update the parent row (month snapshot) accordingly.

4️⃣ Visual Consistency
Ensure:

Same typography, padding, spacing, and buttons as the rest of the site (Dashboard, Holdings, Transactions).

Use the same Save/Cancel or Edit flow as the Holdings edit modal or Transactions edit.

5️⃣ Summary of Actions
Feature	Action
Snapshot Accordion	Display category rows with same structure as main snapshot list
Editable Fields	Allow editing of Total Value and Invested per category
P&L Calculations	Auto-calculate P&L (€) and P&L (%)
Actions	Use Save/Edit buttons consistent with the app’s design
Auto-update	Reflect changes in snapshot totals dynamically

Final instruction to Replit AI:
Apply these UI and functional changes to the Snapshot accordion component.
Ensure that the expanded category breakdown matches the visual and interactive style of the rest of the app.
Test snapshot editing, category breakdown updates, and consistency of calculations.
