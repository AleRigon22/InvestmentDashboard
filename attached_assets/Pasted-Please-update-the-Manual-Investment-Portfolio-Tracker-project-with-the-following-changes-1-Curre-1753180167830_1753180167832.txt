Please update the Manual Investment Portfolio Tracker project with the following changes:

1️⃣ Current Price – Simplify Editing Flow
Current issue:
Current Price is edited via a separate button, and may be linked incorrectly to transaction dates.

Required fix:
Remove the dedicated "Edit Current Price" button.

Make the Current Price directly editable by:

Clicking directly on the Current Price field in the Holdings table (inline edit).

Using the Edit Asset modal, where Current Price is part of the asset data.

Do not link Current Price to any date.
It is just a manual value, editable at any moment without historical tracking.

2️⃣ Accordion UI – Remove Hover Effect
Current issue:
In the Snapshot accordion, the category rows have a light blue background and the hover state changes the opacity, making the UI inconsistent.

Required fix:
Make the category rows in the accordion always white, no background color change.

Remove any hover effect that changes the color or opacity.

Keep the design clean and consistent with the rest of the app.

3️⃣ Snapshots – Prevent Fake Values for Empty Categories
Current issue:
If a category has no assets, the system currently inserts fake placeholder values.

Required fix:
When there are no assets in a category, show:

Field	Value
Total Value	0
Invested	0
P&L (€)	0
P&L (%)	0%

Do not insert any artificial data. Categories without assets must display zero values by default.

4️⃣ Graph Time Range – Fix Dropdown Functionality
Current issue:
The time range dropdown in both Dashboard and History graphs is non-functional.

Required fix:
Remove the 1M option.

Implement these ranges:

Option	Behavior
3M	Show last 3 months
6M	Show last 6 months
YTD	Show data from Jan 1st of current year
Max	Show all historical data

When the user selects a range, the graph must:

Filter the data points immediately

Auto-scale the Y-axis correctly

Update without requiring a page refresh

Apply this fix to both the Dashboard graph and the History graph.

5️⃣ Summary of Actions
Feature	Action
Current Price Edit	Remove button; allow inline edit or via Edit Asset modal
Accordion UI	Remove hover effect and light blue background; use white background always
Snapshot Zero Values	Show 0 values for categories with no assets; no placeholders
Graph Time Range	Fix dropdown to use 3M, 6M, YTD, Max; filter data correctly

Final instruction to Replit AI:
Apply these changes directly to the current project.
Ensure the Holdings, Snapshot accordion, and Portfolio graphs are fully consistent and user-friendly.
Test inline editing, snapshot display, and graph interaction across all flows.
