Please restructure the Dashboard layout to follow a cleaner and more modular format, inspired by the portfolio reference provided.
Here‚Äôs exactly what I need:

üîù 1. Replace ‚ÄúPortfolio Summary‚Äù Box with Individual Cards
Remove the single combined "Portfolio Summary" card currently in the middle section.

Instead, display each metric as a separate card, similar to the top-level style already used for:

Net Worth

Portfolio Value

Total Deposited

Unrealized P&L

Realized P&L

Each card should include:

Label

Value

Optional subtext (e.g., ‚ÄúOpen positions‚Äù, ‚ÄúMoney invested‚Äù)

Colored icon matching the existing theme

Ensure spacing and height are consistent across all 5 cards in a single row.

üìä 2. Add 3 Donut Charts
Add the following charts exactly like in the reference screenshot:

a. Asset Type Allocation
Donut chart showing allocation between:

Stocks

ETFs

Crypto

Bonds/Funds

Central label: Total Portfolio Value

Use the same color scheme used in Holdings and Line Graph

b. Stocks / ETFs / Bonds Holdings Allocation
Donut chart showing individual stocks, ETFs, or funds held

Include a full-color legend listing each asset name and percentage

Data source: current holdings in those categories

c. Crypto Holdings Allocation
Donut chart showing crypto holdings by percentage

Full-color legend below or beside the chart

Data source: current crypto assets in Holdings

All three charts should use consistent dimensions, spacing, and font styling. Position them in a responsive grid below the top cards.

üéØ Design Requirements:
The top area of the dashboard should only include the 5 individual cards listed above ‚Äî no combined summary blocks.

Below the cards: show the donut charts in a clean 2x2 layout or stacked vertically depending on screen size.

The section for Top & Bottom Performers and the existing Portfolio Performance graph should stay visible at the bottom.

Match the minimal, clean look shown in the provided portfolio tracker image (rounded cards, shadow, consistent spacing).

Let me know which files or component logic need to be updated to handle this layout, and how the chart data should be structured or passed from Holdings.
