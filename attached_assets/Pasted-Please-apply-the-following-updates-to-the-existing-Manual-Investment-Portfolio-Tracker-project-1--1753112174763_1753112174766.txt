Please apply the following updates to the existing Manual Investment Portfolio Tracker project:

1️⃣ Edit Asset – Pre-fill Asset Name and Ticker
Current issue:
When editing an asset via the Holdings Edit Modal, the Asset Name and Ticker fields do not show the values previously entered.

Required fix:

Ensure that when the user opens the Edit Asset modal, the following fields are pre-filled with the data already stored:

Field	Behavior
Asset Name	Pre-filled with the current name of the asset
Ticker	Pre-filled with the current ticker of the asset

The user must be able to modify these fields if needed, but the default values must reflect the existing stored data.

2️⃣ Fee Handling – Correct Impact on Total Value
Current issue:
Currently, fees are not correctly deducted from the invested capital during buy/sell operations.

Required behavior:
Buy Transaction:
The Quantity and Unit Price remain as input by the user.

The total invested amount is:

Copia
Modifica
Total Buy = (Quantity × Unit Price) – Fees
Sell Transaction:
The Quantity and Unit Price remain as input by the user.

The total cash received is:

mathematica
Copia
Modifica
Total Sell = (Quantity × Unit Price) – Fees
Impact on calculations:
Calculation	Behavior
Average Price	Always based on Unit Price, not affected by fees
Market Value (book value)	Sum of all (buy amounts – fees) minus all (sell amounts – fees)
P&L	Use the current price × quantity minus the adjusted book value

3️⃣ Summary of Actions
Feature	Action
Asset Edit Modal	Pre-fill Asset Name and Ticker with stored values
Fee Logic	Deduct fees from total transaction value but keep unit price unchanged

Example Scenario – Buy Case
Action	Example
Buy	1 share at €10
Fee	€1
Total Invested	€9 (10 – 1)
Average Price	€10

Final instruction to Replit AI:
Update the current project to implement these changes.
Ensure the Edit Asset modal is fully pre-filled, and buy/sell transactions correctly account for fees in total invested/received amounts while maintaining accurate unit price tracking.

Test the full flow including buys, sells, P&L calculations, and editing assets.
