Please apply the following fixes to the Manual Investment Portfolio Tracker project:

1️⃣ Sell Action – Fix the Sell Flow
Current issue:
When trying to sell an asset, the Sell action (– button) does not work properly.

Required fix:

Open a Sell Transaction Modal when the user clicks – on an asset in Holdings.

The modal must include:

Asset name and ticker (pre-filled, not editable).

Quantity to sell (input by user, must be ≤ current quantity).

Unit price of the sale (input by user).

Fees (optional input).

Date of transaction (default to today, editable).

Validation rules:

Cannot sell more than the current quantity.

Quantity > 0.

After saving:

Decrease the asset's quantity.

Adjust the Market Value (book value).

Update P&L calculations.

If 100% of the quantity is sold, mark the asset as closed but keep it in the list for historical purposes (show in "Closed Positions").

Handle updates immediately in the UI (no page reload required).

2️⃣ Edit Action – Pre-Fill All Fields with Existing Data
Current issue:
When clicking Edit (✏️) on an asset, the modal opens with empty fields or placeholders instead of pre-filled values.

Required fix:

When the user clicks Edit, the modal must display all current data pre-filled, not placeholders.

Fields to pre-fill:

Field	Pre-filled?
Asset Name	✅
Ticker	✅
Category	✅
Sector	✅
Region	✅
Currency	✅
Quantity	✅
Average Price	✅
Current Price	✅
Market Value	✅

Allow the user to update any of these fields and save changes.

After saving, refresh the Holdings table and recalculate all impacted metrics (Market Value, P&L, etc.).

3️⃣ Summary of Required Changes
Feature	Action
Sell Action	Fix the Sell modal and logic. Handle partial and full sales correctly.
Edit Action	Pre-fill all fields in the Edit modal with existing data. No placeholders.

Final instruction to Replit AI:
Update the existing project with these fixes.
Ensure the Sell and Edit modals are fully functional, with proper data binding, validations, and UI updates.
Test for both partial sales, full asset closures, and asset edits.
