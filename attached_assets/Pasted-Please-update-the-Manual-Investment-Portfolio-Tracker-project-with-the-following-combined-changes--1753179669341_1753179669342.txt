Please update the Manual Investment Portfolio Tracker project with the following combined changes:

1️⃣ Login – Automatic Redirect to Dashboard
Current issue:
After login, the user remains on the login page and has to refresh manually.

Required fix:
After successful login, automatically redirect the user to the Dashboard (Portfolio Overview).

Use client-side navigation (e.g., navigate("/dashboard") or equivalent).

Ensure the authentication token/session is properly saved before redirecting.

Do not require manual page refresh.

2️⃣ Portfolio Performance Graph – Y-Axis and Time Range Selector Fix
Current issues:
The Y-axis is stuck at €0 regardless of the actual data.

The time range selector is not functional.

Required fixes:
Y-Axis Auto-Scaling:
Make the Y-axis dynamically adjust to the highest value in the selected data range.

The graph must always start at €0 and scale appropriately.

Time Range Selector – Updated Options:
New Option	Behavior
3M	Show the last 3 months of data
6M	Show the last 6 months of data
YTD	Show data from January 1st of the current year to today
Max	Show all historical data available

Interaction behavior:
When the user switches between the ranges, the graph must:

Filter the data points accordingly

Auto-scale the Y-axis

Render the graph immediately without requiring a page refresh

3️⃣ Scope of the Change
Apply these fixes to both the Dashboard graph and the History graph if the same issue exists there.

Use the snapshots as data source for both graphs to ensure consistency.

4️⃣ Summary of Actions
Feature	Action
Login Redirect	Redirect to Dashboard automatically after login
Y-Axis Scaling	Make the graph Y-axis dynamic, starting from €0
Time Range Selector	Use only: 3M, 6M, YTD, Max
Graph Interaction	Update graphs immediately based on user selection

Final instruction to Replit AI:
Apply all these changes to the current project.
Ensure a smooth login flow, correct graph scaling, and functional time range filtering in both the Dashboard and History sections.

Test the user journey from login to dashboard, and validate all time range selections on the performance graph.
