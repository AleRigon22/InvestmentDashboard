Please update the Manual Investment Portfolio Tracker project with the following fixes and improvements:

1️⃣ Login – Automatic Redirect
Current issue:
After login, the user stays on the login page and needs to refresh manually.

Required fix:
After successful login:

Automatically redirect the user to the Portfolio Dashboard (Holdings or main page).

Use standard client-side navigation (React Router or equivalent).

Ensure the token/session is properly saved before redirection.

2️⃣ Current Price – Fix Update Logic
Current issue:
When trying to update the Current Price of an asset, the value is not saved or reflected in calculations.

Required fix:
Ensure the Current Price can be edited from:

The Holdings page (inline or via Edit modal)

The Single Asset page (if applicable)

After saving the new Current Price:

Update the asset state.

Recalculate:

Market Value = Current Price × Quantity

Unrealized P&L

Reflect the change in all relevant pages and graphs without reload.

3️⃣ History Graph – Remove P/L Line, Add Asset Types
Current issue:
In the History section graph, there is a P/L line which is not needed.

Required fix:
Remove the P/L line from the History graph.

Add separate lines for each asset class to show the evolution of portfolio composition over time:

Line	Represents
Stocks	Total market value of stocks per month
ETFs	Total market value of ETFs per month
Crypto	Total market value of cryptocurrencies per month
Bonds	Total market value of bonds/funds per month

Keep the Deposits line to show cumulative deposits over time.

The graph must clearly display the evolution of the portfolio composition month by month.

4️⃣ Summary of Actions
Feature	Action
Login	Redirect to Dashboard after login
Current Price	Fix update/save logic and recalculate Market Value & P&L
History Graph	Remove P/L line; add lines for Stocks, ETFs, Crypto, Bonds

Final instruction to Replit AI:
Apply these fixes directly to the current project.
