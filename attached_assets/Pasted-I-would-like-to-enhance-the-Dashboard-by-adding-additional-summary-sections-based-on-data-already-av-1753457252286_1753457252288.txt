I would like to enhance the Dashboard by adding additional summary sections based on data already available from the Holdings and History pages.

üìå New Sections to Add:
1. Unrealized vs Realized P&L
Display two separate cards:

Unrealized P&L: calculated from currently held assets (active positions in the Holdings page).

Realized P&L: calculated from closed transactions or profit/loss logged in the History page.

Each card should show:

Total value in euros

Percentage gain/loss

Color-coded (green for positive, red for negative)

2. Net Worth
Show total Net Worth as a top-level metric.

Formula:

Modifica
Net Worth = Portfolio Value + Available Funds (if implemented)
Display this metric as its own card in the top row.

3. Total Deposited
Add a card labeled ‚ÄúTotal Deposited‚Äù or ‚ÄúTotal Money In‚Äù

Pull this value from cumulative deposits tracked in the History or transaction logs.

4. Summary Section (Text-based Box)
Add a visual summary box (like a text block or compact panel) below the main metrics that shows:

Net Worth

Total Portfolio Value

Total Deposited

Cost Basis

Unrealized P&L

Realized P&L

Total P&L

Paid Fees

Dividends received

Number of assets with profit ("Assets Up")

Number of assets in loss ("Assets Down")

All of this data can be derived from Holdings and History.

5. Performance: Top / Low Performers
Create a new card in the lower section of the dashboard that displays:

Top 2 assets with the highest profit (based on P&L from Holdings)

Bottom 2 assets with the biggest losses

Show:

Asset name

Total profit/loss in euros

Percentage gain/loss

Optional: up/down arrow icon and label (e.g. "Top Performer")

üé® Design Notes:
Match the style of the existing dashboard (rounded corners, consistent spacing, light background).

All metric cards should align to the grid used in the current layout.

Use same fonts, colors and iconography used in the current dashboard cards.

üìÇ Data Sources:
Use Holdings to get current assets, market values, and unrealized P&L.

Use History (snapshots and/or transactions) to calculate realized P&L, deposits, dividends, and fees.

Let me know which component files or structure to adjust and how to integrate the calculations efficiently across pages.
