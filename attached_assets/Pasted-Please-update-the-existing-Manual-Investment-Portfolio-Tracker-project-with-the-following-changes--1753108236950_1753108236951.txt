Please update the existing Manual Investment Portfolio Tracker project with the following changes:

1️⃣ Portfolio Title Customization
Current issue:
The app currently displays "Portfolio Tracker" as a static title.

Required fix:

Change the portfolio title to:
"Portafoglio di [username]", where [username] is the logged-in user’s name.

Next to the title, add a pencil icon (✏️) to allow the user to edit their portfolio name.

Behavior:
On click of the pencil icon:

Open a small inline text input or modal to edit the portfolio name.

Save the new name to the user’s profile.

After saving, update the header to show the new name (e.g., "Portafoglio di Marco" could become "Portafoglio Obiettivo 2025").

If the user does not set a custom name, default to "Portafoglio di [username]".

2️⃣ Dividends Page – Remove Ex-Date
Current issue:
The dividends form and history include both ex-date and payment date, but this is unnecessary for the app’s purpose.

Required fix:

Remove the ex-date field from:

The dividend input form.

The dividend data model and UI display.

Only keep the payment date, which represents the actual dividend cash flow.

3️⃣ Fix Dividend Entry – Ensure Adding Dividends Works
Current issue:
Adding a dividend transaction currently does not work or fails silently.

Required fix:

Ensure that the "Add Dividend" function works correctly:

Save the dividend to the user’s portfolio.

Associate the dividend with the correct asset.

Update the Dividends Page, the Dividend History list, and the Monthly Dividend Flow chart dynamically.

Fields required for dividend entry:

Asset name (select from existing assets)

Payment date

Amount received (€)

Optional note

After adding a dividend:

The system must update all relevant charts and lists immediately (no page reload required).

If no dividends exist prior to this, remove the "zero state" message and show the new data.

Portfolio Name	Show "Portafoglio di [username]" with an editable pencil icon. Allow name change.
