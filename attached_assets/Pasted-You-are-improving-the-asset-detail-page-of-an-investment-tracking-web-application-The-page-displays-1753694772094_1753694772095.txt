You are improving the asset detail page of an investment tracking web application. The page displays detailed information for both active and closed assets. Below are the required updates and improvements, structured by context:

---

ðŸ”µ GENERAL CHANGES FOR ALL ASSETS (active and closed):

1. Update the action buttons ("Add Transaction", "Add Dividend") to be **automatically linked to the specific asset currently open**. 
   - These buttons should no longer ask to select an asset if the user is already on the detail page of a specific one.

2. In the Holdings list, remove the "Closed" label next to categories like "Stocks" and "Crypto" inside the **Closed Positions** accordion, since it is redundant.

---

ðŸŸ¢ ACTIVE ASSETS PAGE:

1. âœ… **Info blocks at the top** (6 cards):
   - Keep current structure: Total Invested, Quantity Held, Market Value, Avg. Buy Price, Realized P&L, Unrealized P&L.

2. âœ… **Transaction History section**:
   - Add a row summarizing the **total fees paid**, combining buy and sell fees. 
     - Label: `Total Fees: â‚¬X.XX`

3. âœ… **Investment Performance Chart**:
   - The chart has two toggle modes: `Currency` and `% Percentage`.
   - In **Currency mode**, show two lines: Invested Value and Market Value.
   - In **Percentage mode**, show only **one line**: percentage change in value over time based on the first investment.
     - Remove the "Baseline (0%)" line.
   - Ensure that the toggle between 1M / 3M / 1Y / MAX updates the chart correctly.

4. âœ… **Tooltip Fixes**:
   - Tooltip on hover should correctly show date and value (either % or â‚¬ depending on the mode).

---

ðŸ”´ CLOSED ASSETS PAGE:

1. âœ… **Top section blocks**:
   - Reorganize to show **only the relevant data for closed assets**. Suggested structure:
     - `Total Invested`
     - `Avg. Buy Price` â†’ this must **retain its historical value**, not be zero.
     - `Final Realized P&L` â†’ clearly labeled.
     - `Holding Duration` (already displayed)
     - Remove or disable `Unrealized P&L` and `Market Value` blocks (or replace them with archived values).

2. âœ… **Transaction History section**:
   - As for active assets, add a row with **total fees paid**.

3. âœ… **Investment Performance Chart**:
   - In **Currency mode**, do not drop Market Value to 0 at the sell date.
     - The chart should retain and display **historical market value over time** until the close date.
   - In **Percentage mode**, show only **one line**: the historical performance % over time.
     - Do not show Baseline (0%) or a second % line.

4. âœ… **Tooltip Fixes**:
   - Ensure tooltips show correct values and dates as in the active asset page.

Make sure all UI/UX elements remain consistent across both active and closed assets. All numbers should reflect the user's portfolio based on real past transactions and remain accessible for reference even after positions are closed.
