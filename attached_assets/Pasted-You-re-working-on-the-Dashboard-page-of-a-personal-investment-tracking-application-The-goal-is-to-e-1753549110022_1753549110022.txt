You're working on the Dashboard page of a personal investment tracking application. The goal is to enhance the display of key performance indicators and portfolio data accuracy, while maintaining a clean, professional layout.

Please apply the following improvements specifically to the Dashboard page:

---

📊 KPI Block Enhancements:
1. Separate **Realized P&L** and **Unrealized P&L** into two distinct cards.  
   - Realized P&L = profit from sell transactions only  
   - Unrealized P&L = current value - cost basis for open positions  
   - Optionally keep a "Total P&L" block that combines both

2. Add a new KPI card for **Total Fees Paid**  
   - This should sum all transaction fees manually entered or tracked per trade

3. Ensure **Total Value**, **Cost Basis**, and **Total Dividends** remain in their current order

---

📈 Portfolio Performance Chart:
4. Apply **auto-scaling** to the Y-axis so the chart better adapts to small portfolio values  
5. Allow toggling between:
   - "All Positions"  
   - "Only Active Holdings" (exclude closed assets from the chart)

---

🟢 Allocation Charts:
6. Ensure the **Asset Type Allocation** pie chart:
   - Uses consistent colors by asset type:  
     • Stocks: #3B82F6  
     • ETFs: #22C55E  
     • Crypto: #F97316  
     • Bonds: #8B5CF6

7. Remove any **duplicate charts** (only one allocation chart per type should exist)

8. Fix the “Stocks / ETFs / Bonds Allocation” chart so it correctly reflects current holdings with accurate labels and data

---

🏆 Top & Bottom Performers:
9. For each asset shown, display both:
   - The **percentage return**
   - The **actual € return** (e.g. +409% / +€80)

---

💡 General:
10. Ensure all charts and data shown **exclude closed positions** where appropriate (unless explicitly selected)
11. Maintain mobile responsiveness and clean component spacing

---

Do not alter other pages. Apply these changes only to the Dashboard. Ensure that all data continues to be pulled from the existing state or data structure without disrupting logic elsewhere in the application.
