Please apply the following changes to the existing Manual Investment Portfolio Tracker project:

1️⃣ Dashboard – Fix "View All" Navigation
Current issue:
The "View All" button in the Dashboard does not navigate to the Holdings page.

Required fix:

Ensure that clicking "View All" correctly routes the user to the Holdings page.

Use the standard navigation flow (React Router or equivalent) to handle this action.

2️⃣ Holdings Icons – Simplify Badge Text
Current issue:
Currently, the icon in the circle shows the full ticker or text, making the interface cluttered.

Required change:

Inside the circle badge, display only the first letter of the asset name in uppercase.

Remove the ticker or additional text from inside the badge.

Keep the category color scheme as previously specified:

Asset Category	Color
Stock	Blue
ETF	Green
Crypto	Orange
Bond	Purple
Cash	Grey

3️⃣ Full Asset Sell – Error on Selling All
Current issue:
When trying to sell 100% of an asset, the system throws an error.

Required fix:

Correct the Sell Transaction logic to allow full quantity sales without error.

After selling all shares or units of an asset:

Set quantity to zero

Keep the asset visible in the Closed Positions section or add a toggle to show/hide closed positions.

Properly calculate realized P&L and holding period.

Ensure the app handles partial sells, full sells, and subsequent buys correctly, maintaining a consistent transaction history.

4️⃣ Monthly Dividend Flow – Remove Dummy Data
Current issue:
The Monthly Dividend Flow chart displays data even when no dividends have been entered.

Required fix:

Remove any pre-filled or demo data from the Monthly Dividend Flow chart.

When no dividends are recorded, display a zero state message, such as:
"No dividends recorded yet. Add your first dividend to see the monthly flow."

Once the user adds dividend transactions, populate the chart dynamically with real data only.

5️⃣ Summary of Actions
Feature	Action
Dashboard	Fix "View All" navigation to Holdings
Holdings Icons	Show first letter of asset name in colored badge
Sell Logic	Allow full asset sell without errors; handle closed positions
Dividend Chart	Remove fake data; show real user data or zero state

Final instruction to Replit AI:
Update the existing project with these fixes.
Ensure that navigation, transaction handling, UI elements, and charts behave as described.
Test the entire flow including full asset sales, navigation, and empty states.
