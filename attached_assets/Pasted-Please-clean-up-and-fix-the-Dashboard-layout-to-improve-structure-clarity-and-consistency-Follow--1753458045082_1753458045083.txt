Please clean up and fix the Dashboard layout to improve structure, clarity, and consistency.
Follow these detailed instructions:

🔴 1. Remove These Unnecessary Blocks
Completely remove the following blocks from the dashboard:

Total P&L (Combined return)

Paid Fees

Dividends YTD

Assets Up

Assets Down

Total Assets

Closed Trades

These metrics are redundant or not needed in the top section.

✅ 2. Top Row – Keep Only These 4 Cards (In This Order)
The top of the dashboard should contain exactly these 4 cards, horizontally aligned:

Total Value – Current market value of the portfolio

Cost Basis – Total invested amount

P&L – Profit & Loss (current)

Total Dividends – Total dividends received

Each card should follow the same styling as current cards (icon, color, subtitle).

📈 3. Portfolio Performance Chart
Move the Portfolio Performance line chart to appear immediately below the top 4 cards.

It should span the full width beneath the cards.

🔁 4. Remove Duplicate "Asset Type Allocation" Chart
You currently have two pie charts titled “Asset Allocation” or “Asset Type Allocation”.

Keep only one, preferably the version that already uses consistent colors with other charts (e.g., Stocks, Crypto, Bonds, etc.)

🔧 5. Fix the “Stocks / ETFs / Bonds” Chart
Rename the chart to: "Stocks / ETFs / Bonds Allocation"

This chart currently shows a blank placeholder.

It should display a donut chart showing the breakdown of all current stock, ETF, and bond holdings, with:

Segment values based on market value

Labels and legend for each asset

Consistent color scheme with the Holdings page and line chart

Source data from currently held assets in these categories.

🧩 Layout Notes:
All charts (Asset Allocation, Stocks/ETFs/Bonds Allocation, Crypto Holdings) should be arranged in a grid layout below the Portfolio Performance chart.

Keep consistent spacing, rounded corners, shadow, and font size.

The “Top & Bottom Performers” section should stay below these charts.

Let me know what component files or layout containers need to be updated to implement these changes properly.
