Please update the Manual Investment Portfolio Tracker project with the following changes:

1️⃣ Rename "Last Price" to "Current Price"
Current issue:
The system displays Last Price, but this is misleading since there is no live price feed.

Required change:

Rename "Last Price" to "Current Price" everywhere in the app:

Holdings table

Asset detail page

Transaction forms

Current Price is fully manual:

The user can edit the Current Price at any time.

No automatic update is performed.

This field is essential for personal valuation purposes only.

2️⃣ Make "Current Price" Always Editable
Add an inline edit option for Current Price directly in the Holdings table or in the Asset Edit modal.

Changes to Current Price should:

Immediately update the Market Value.

Recalculate the P&L (Profit & Loss).

3️⃣ Market Value Calculation Logic Change
Current issue:
Market Value is currently calculated as:
Quantity × Current Price

Required change:
Market Value must represent the sum of all buy transactions minus sell transactions for that asset, regardless of the Current Price.

New Formula for Market Value:
mathematica
Copia
Modifica
Market Value = Σ(Buy Quantity × Buy Price) – Σ(Sell Quantity × Sell Price)
This reflects the real invested amount (book value) and tracks the total capital actually put into the position.

Current Price is only used for calculating potential gains/losses, not for Market Value.

4️⃣ P&L Calculation Logic
Unrealized P&L should still be calculated using the Current Price, to show the potential gain or loss:

sql
Copia
Modifica
Unrealized P&L = (Current Price × Quantity Held) – Market Value
P&L %:

sql
Copia
Modifica
P&L % = ((Current Price × Quantity Held) ÷ Market Value – 1) × 100
If Market Value = 0, display a "N/A" or handle gracefully to avoid division by zero.

5️⃣ Summary of Required Changes
Area	Action
Label Change	Rename "Last Price" to "Current Price"
Editability	Make Current Price always editable manually
Market Value	Calculate as sum of transactions (not using Current Price)
P&L	Use Current Price for unrealized P&L, keep Market Value based on buys/sells

Final instruction to Replit AI:
Apply these changes directly to the existing project structure.
Ensure all pages, calculations, and tables reflect the new logic.
Test the full flow end-to-end, including buying, selling, price updates, and P&L visualization.
