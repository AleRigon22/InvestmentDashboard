Please update the existing Manual Investment Portfolio Tracker project with the following changes:

1️⃣ Holdings Page – Action Buttons
Current issue:
The action buttons (+, –, ✏️) in the Holdings table do not work properly.

Required fixes:

Edit (✏️):

When clicking on the edit icon, allow the user to modify all asset fields:

Name

Ticker

Category

Sector

Region

Currency

Average Price

Quantity

Notes

Save changes and update calculations accordingly.

Buy (+):

Open a "New Buy Transaction" modal pre-filled with the selected asset.

Fields required:

Quantity

Unit Price

Date

Fees

Sell (–):

Open a "New Sell Transaction" modal pre-filled with the selected asset.

Fields required:

Quantity

Unit Price

Date

Fees

After saving a transaction, update the Holdings table immediately (quantity, average price, market value, P/L).

2️⃣ Fix Market Value and P/L Calculation
Current issue:
After adding a Buy Transaction, the system displays $0.00 market value and -100% P/L even if assets are present.

Required behavior:

Market Value = Quantity × Last Price

P/L = (Last Price – Avg Price) × Quantity

P/L % = ((Last Price / Avg Price) – 1) × 100

Additional rule:

If Last Price is not yet entered by the user, default it to 0 but allow the user to add it manually.

When Last Price is zero, display “Price Missing” warning instead of calculating P/L to avoid misleading values.

3️⃣ Unique Color and Icon per Asset
New requirement:

Each asset must display a different icon and color in the Holdings table.

Example mapping (for inspiration):

Asset Category	Icon	Color
Stocks	📈	Blue
ETFs	📊	Green
Crypto	🪙	Orange
Bonds	💵	Purple
Cash	💰	Grey

Icons and colors should be visually consistent across the app (Holdings, Charts, Dividends).

Use category-specific icons or fallback to initials if no icon is available.

4️⃣ Summary of Actions
Area	Action
Holdings Actions	Fix + / – / Edit buttons to open the correct modals and handle data updates
Transactions	Ensure buy/sell correctly update quantity, avg price, market value, and P/L
Market Value	Fix calculations and show warning when prices are missing
Visuals	Add unique color and icon per asset

Final instruction to Replit AI:
Apply these changes directly to the existing project.
Ensure the Holdings page becomes fully interactive, the P/L and Market Value calculations are correct, and the visual design is clear and intuitive.
Test the full flow end-to-end.
