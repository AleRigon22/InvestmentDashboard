You are tasked with building a modern investment portfolio tracking application similar to apps like Getquin, Trade Republic, or Holistiq. The goal is to display a user's real investment performance including realized profits, unrealized gains, cost basis, fees paid, and dividends collected.

The UI is already partially structured with the following main pages: 
- Dashboard
- Holdings
- Trades (Transaction History)
- Dividends
- Asset Detail Page
- History (Performance over time)

Please implement the following logic and structure across the app:

---

üß† PROFIT CALCULATION LOGIC:
1. **Cost Basis (Total Invested)**: Sum of all buy transactions, including reinvested capital, minus the cost of sold portions (proportional).
2. **Realized Profit**: Sum of profits from all sell transactions (sell price ‚Äì cost basis for the quantity sold).
3. **Unrealized Profit**: For current holdings, calculate:  
   `(Current Price - Average Buy Price) √ó Quantity`
4. **Total Return** = `Realized Profit + Unrealized Profit + Dividends - Fees`
5. **Fees Paid**: Allow manual input or fixed per trade. These should subtract from the total return.
6. **Dividends**: Track manually inserted dividends per asset. Include them in the "Total Return" but display them separately too.

---

üìä DASHBOARD:
- Top-level KPIs (cards):
  - **Total Value** = sum of current market value of all open positions
  - **Cost Basis** = total invested amount (active)
  - **Total P&L** = Total Return (see logic above)
  - **Total Dividends Received**
  - (Optional) **Fees Paid**
- Below KPIs, display the **"Portfolio Performance"** chart with the growth over time and comparison by asset classes (Stocks, ETFs, Crypto, Bonds, etc.)
- Pie charts:
  - Allocation by asset class (color-coded per type)
  - Allocation by ticker (current open positions only)
- Top & Bottom Performers list (based on % return of each asset)

---

üìÅ HOLDINGS PAGE:
- List grouped by category (e.g., Stocks, Crypto)
- Columns:
  - Asset | Quantity | Avg Buy Price | Current Price | Market Value | Unrealized P&L
- Option to expand to show individual lots and their performance (FIFO or average)

---

üîÅ TRADES PAGE:
- Full transaction history
- Each row: Date | Asset | Type (Buy/Sell) | Quantity | Price | Total | Fees
- Sell transactions must reduce cost basis and calculate realized profit correctly.

---

üìà HISTORY PAGE:
- Monthly snapshots of:
  - Total Portfolio Value
  - Invested Amount (Cost Basis)
  - P&L
  - Breakdown per asset type
- Historical line chart showing growth over time
- Make sure values shown reflect deposits, sales, value changes and dividends correctly

---

üìÑ DIVIDENDS PAGE:
- Bar chart per month with dividend totals
- Each bar is split by asset (color-coded), with hover tooltips showing asset name and dividend value
- Top cards: YTD, This Month, Average Monthly
- Table with all dividend entries (Date | Asset | Amount)

---

üìä ASSET DETAIL PAGE:
- Show personal position in the asset:
  - Quantity | Avg Price | Current Price | Unrealized Gain
- Realized profit (if sold portions in past)
- Monthly bar chart of dividends from that asset
- Line chart: user‚Äôs investment value vs current market price over time

---

üíæ OTHER TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- All calculations must respect partial sells, reinvestments, and multiple lots (FIFO or average).
- Make sure selling an asset reduces invested amount and transfers it to "realized gains".
- Dividends and fees are tracked separately, but both impact total performance.
- Keep currency consistent across all views (‚Ç¨, $ etc.)
- Use smart color palette: distinguish Stocks, Crypto, ETFs, Bonds.

This is not a trading app, it's a personal investment tracker. Do not include live pricing, news, or APIs at this stage. All prices and dividends are entered manually by the user.

Build the app with clean UI/UX and components suitable for portfolio visualization.
