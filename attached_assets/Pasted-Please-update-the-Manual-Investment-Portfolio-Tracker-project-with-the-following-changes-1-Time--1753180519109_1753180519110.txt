Please update the Manual Investment Portfolio Tracker project with the following changes:

1️⃣ Time Range Selector – Graph Filtering Fix
Current issue:
The time range dropdown shows correct options (3M, 6M, YTD, Max), but the graphs do not respond correctly when selecting 3M or 6M.

Required fix:
Ensure that selecting 3M or 6M correctly filters the data in all graphs, including:

Dashboard graph

History graph

The graphs must:

Show only the data points corresponding to the selected range.

Auto-scale the Y-axis to the filtered data set (no 0-only axis).

Update in real time without needing a page refresh.

2️⃣ Login Redirect – Fix Immediate Navigation
Current issue:
After logging in, the app still requires a manual refresh to navigate to the Dashboard.

Required fix:
On successful login:

Immediately redirect the user to the Dashboard (Portfolio Overview page) without requiring manual page refresh.

Use standard React navigation (e.g., navigate("/dashboard")).

Ensure session/token saving happens before redirecting.

3️⃣ Current Price Edit – Remove Dollar Button and Use Modal
Current issue:
Currently, there is a blue dollar button to edit the Current Price. This is inconsistent with the rest of the UI.

Required fix:
Remove the blue dollar button from the Holdings table.

Implement this behavior:

Action	Behavior
Click on Current Price	Open a popup/modal (same style as other modals in the app)
Inside the modal:	Input field to enter the new Current Price
Buttons:	Confirm and Cancel
After saving:	Update the Current Price, recalculate Market Value and P&L immediately

Do not link the Current Price to any transaction date; it remains a manual value.

4️⃣ Summary of Actions
Feature	Action
Graph Filtering	Fix 3M and 6M filtering in Dashboard and History graphs
Login Redirect	Ensure immediate navigation to Dashboard after login
Current Price Edit	Remove dollar button; enable click-to-edit with popup modal

Final instruction to Replit AI:
Apply these changes directly to the current project.
Ensure time range filtering, login flow, and Current Price editing are fully functional and consistent with the rest of the app UX.

Test the full flow including login, graph interactions, and asset editing.
