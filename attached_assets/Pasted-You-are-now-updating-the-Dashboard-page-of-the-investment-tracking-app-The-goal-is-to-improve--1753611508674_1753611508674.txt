You are now updating the **Dashboard page** of the investment tracking app.

The goal is to improve the visual layout and clarity of KPI metrics, enable interactive tooltips, and apply dynamic coloring to pie charts for better differentiation of assets.

Apply the following updates specifically to the Dashboard page:

---

üìê KPI Block Layout (Top Section):
1. Reorder the KPI cards into two clear rows with exactly 3 blocks per row:
   - **Row 1**:
     - Total Value
     - Cost Basis
     - Total Dividends
   - **Row 2**:
     - Total P&L
     - Realized P&L
     - Unrealized P&L

2. Ensure the layout maintains equal spacing and alignment on all screen sizes.
   - On desktop: display two rows of three cards each
   - On mobile: allow stacking vertically or horizontal scrolling if needed

üß© Tooltip Fix:
3. Activate tooltips for all KPI cards.
   - Tooltips should appear on **hover** (desktop) and **tap** (mobile)
   - Provide a short explanation for each metric, for example:
     - **Total Value**: "Current market value of your open positions"
     - **Cost Basis**: "Total capital invested in active holdings"
     - **Total Dividends**: "Sum of all dividends received"
     - **Total P&L**: "Realized + Unrealized P&L ‚Äì Fees + Dividends"
     - **Realized P&L**: "Profit from assets you sold"
     - **Unrealized P&L**: "Gain/loss from current open positions"

üé® Pie Chart Colors (Dynamic Asset Coloring):
4. In the "Stocks / ETFs / Bonds Allocation" and "Crypto Allocation" pie charts:
   - Generate **distinct colors per asset**, not just one color per category
   - Use **color variations derived from the asset type‚Äôs base color**:
     - Stocks/ETFs: base color #3B82F6 (blue) ‚Üí different shades for each asset
     - Crypto: base color #F97316 (orange) ‚Üí different shades for each crypto
   - Use HSL or similar logic to automatically assign unique, distinguishable colors

5. Make sure:
   - Each asset always keeps the same color across the app (Dashboard, Holdings, etc.)
   - If there are more assets than available shades, programmatically rotate through hue/lightness to generate more variants

üõ†Ô∏è General Notes:
- Do not affect any other pages (Holdings, Trades, Dividends, History)
- Maintain existing functionality and logic
- Ensure mobile responsiveness is preserved across layout and charts
